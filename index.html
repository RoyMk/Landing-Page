                <h1>Interstellar Mission</h1>
                <p>Voyager 2 was a groundbreaking NASA space probe launched on August 20, 1977, with a mission to explore the outer planets of our solar system. It was the first and only spacecraft to conduct detailed flybys of all four giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
                <p>Key mission objectives included studying planetary atmospheres, magnetic fields, rings, and moons; capturing high-resolution images and scientific data; and collecting unprecedented insights about the outer solar system.</p>
                <p>After completing its planetary exploration, Voyager 2 transitioned to an extended mission studying interstellar space. On November 5, 2018, it became the second human-made object to enter interstellar medium, providing the first direct measurements of plasma density and temperature beyond our solar system.</p>
                <p>As of November 2024, Voyager 2 continues its journey, located approximately 138.27 AU (20.7 billion km) from Earth, still maintaining communication through NASA's Deep Space Network.</p>

            <h1>Arriving At Jupiter</h1>
            <img alt="big-red-spot" src="resources/great-red-spot.jpg">
            <p>Voyager 2's encounter with Jupiter's Great Red Spot occurred during its closest approach to the planet on
                July 9, 1979, at 22:29 UT. The spacecraft came within 570,000 km (350,000 mi) of Jupiter's cloud tops,
                providing unprecedented views of the iconic storm.</p>
            <p>The flyby revealed the Great Red Spot as a complex storm system moving in a counterclockwise direction.
                Voyager 2's observations confirmed and expanded upon the findings of Voyager 1, which had passed by
                Jupiter a few months earlier. The spacecraft's instruments detected wind speeds of up to 432 km/h (268
                mph) around the edges of the spot.</p>
            <p>Time-lapse movies created from Voyager 2's images dramatically confirmed the Great Red Spot's
                counterclockwise circulation, which had been carefully tracked by Earth-based observations since 1966.
                The data showed that while the spot's edges experience high wind speeds, the currents inside appear
                stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.</p>
            <p>Voyager 2's observations also revealed significant changes in Jupiter's atmosphere since the earlier
                Pioneer missions. The Great Red Spot had drifted and undergone changes in both shape and color. These
                findings highlighted the dynamic nature of Jupiter's atmosphere and the ongoing evolution of its most
                famous feature.</p>

            <h1>Arriving At Uranus</h1>
            <img alt="big-red-spot" src="resources/Uranus_Voyager2_color_calibrated.png">
            <p>Voyager 2's encounter with Uranus occurred on January 24, 1986, providing the first and only close-up
                look at the seventh planet. The spacecraft came within 81,500 km of Uranus' cloud tops.</p>
            <p>Key findings include: a tilted magnetic field offset from the center, 11 new moons, two new rings, and
                data on the planet's atmosphere. The flyby confirmed Uranus' unusual tilt and observed a unique,
                asymmetric magnetosphere.</p>
            <p>Recent analysis suggests Voyager 2's visit coincided with a rare solar wind event, compressing Uranus'
                magnetosphere. This created conditions occurring only about 4% of the time, potentially affecting our
                understanding of the planet.</p>

            <h1>Arriving At Saturn</h1>
            <img alt="big-red-spot" src="resources/Voyager_2_-_Saturn_-_3115_7854_2.png">
            <p>Voyager 2's encounter with Saturn occurred on August 26, 1981, with its closest approach at 03:24:05 UT.
                The spacecraft came within 26,000 miles (41,843 km) of Saturn's cloud tops, providing unprecedented
                views of the ringed planet and its moons.</p>
            <p>During the Saturn flyby, Voyager 2 made several key observations. It measured atmospheric temperatures
                and pressures, finding that the north pole was about 10Â°C cooler than mid-latitudes at certain
                pressures. The spacecraft also revealed new details about Saturn's rings, discovering new thin and faint
                rings, as well as ghostly features called spokes.</p>
            <p>Voyager 2 provided more detailed images of the ring "spokes" and kinks, and also the F-ring and its
                shepherding moons, all found by Voyager 1. The spacecraft's data suggested that Saturn's A-ring was
                perhaps only about 980 feet (300 meters) thick.</p>
            <p>As it flew behind and up past Saturn, the probe passed through the plane of Saturn's rings at a speed of
                8 miles per second (13 kilometers per second). For several minutes during this phase, the spacecraft was
                hit by thousands of micron-sized dust grains that created "puff" plasma as they were vaporized.</p>

            <h1>Arriving At Neptune</h1>
            <img alt="big-red-spot" src="resources/Neptune_clouds.jpg">
            <p>Voyager 2's historic flyby of Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989, marking the first and only close
                encounter with the eighth planet. The spacecraft came within 4,950 km of Neptune's north pole, passing
                just 30 km off its intended target.</p>

            <p>During the encounter, Voyager 2 studied Neptune's atmosphere, rings, magnetosphere, and moons. It
                revealed a dynamic atmosphere with the Great Dark Spot and a fast-moving cloud nicknamed the "Scooter".
                The mission also provided unprecedented data on Neptune's largest moon, Triton, showing its icy surface
                and active geysers.</p>

            <p>The Neptune flyby was the final planetary encounter of Voyager 2's "Grand Tour" of the outer solar
                system. At the time, Neptune was the farthest known body in the Solar System. The spacecraft's
                trajectory was carefully chosen to maximize scientific observations, including radio occultation
                measurements of Neptune's and Triton's atmospheres.</p>

            <p>After the Neptune encounter, Voyager 2 continued its journey into interstellar space. As of February
                2025, it is approximately 18 billion kilometers from Earth, still sending back valuable data about the
                outer reaches of our solar system.</p>
